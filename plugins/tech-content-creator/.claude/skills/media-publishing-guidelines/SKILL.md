**Pitch Email Format**:

```
Subject: [Compelling, specific subject line]

Hi [Editor Name],

[Personal connection if any - saw your article on X, we met at Y conference]

I'd like to pitch an article on [TOPIC]:

**Headline**: [Working headline]

**Angle**: [What's new/different/newsworthy about this]

**Why now**: [Timeliness - trend, event, data]

**Why me**: [Your credentials and unique perspective]

**What readers get**: [Key takeaways and value]

**Format**: [Opinion piece, tutorial, analysis] - [estimated word count]

[Optional: Key supporting points]

- Point 3

I can deliver a draft within [timeframe]. Would this be a good fit for [Publication]?

Best regards,
[Name]
[Title, Company]
[Relevant links: LinkedIn, previous articles, etc.]
```

### Pitch Elements to Include

**Hook / News Angle**:
- What makes this timely?
- What's the surprising insight?
- What data or research backs this?
- How does it connect to current trends?

**Unique Value**:
- Why are you the right person to write this?
- What unique data or experience do you have?
- What perspective can only you provide?

**Reader Benefit**:
- What will readers learn?
- What can they do with this information?
- How does it help them solve problems?

**Evidence of Quality**:
- Links to previous published articles
- Credentials and expertise
- Any relevant data or research

### Common Pitch Mistakes

❌ **Too vague**: "I want to write about cloud computing"
✅ **Specific**: "I want to analyze why 3 of the 5 largest cloud outages in 2024 shared a common architectural flaw—and how enterprises can avoid it"

❌ **All about you/company**: "Our product is amazing and..."
✅ **Reader-focused**: "CIOs struggling with [problem] can benefit from [approach] that reduced our costs by 60%"

❌ **No research**: "I think this would be interesting..."
✅ **Data-backed**: "According to [source], 67% of companies face [problem]—here's what our research revealed..."

❌ **Generic**: Could apply to any publication
✅ **Targeted**: "Given [Publication]'s focus on [topic], this aligns with..."

## Editorial Relationships

### Building Long-Term Relationships

**Start Small**:
- Comment thoughtfully on articles
- Share publication content with insights
- Attend publication events/webinars
- Build Twitter/LinkedIn connection

**Deliver Quality**:
- First article must be exceptional
- Meet deadlines reliably
- Respond quickly to editor feedback
- Understand publication's audience

**Be Professional**:
- Respect editorial judgment
- Don't argue about edits (unless factual errors)
- Thank editors publicly
- Don't burn bridges

**Add Value**:
- Offer exclusive data or insights
- Provide expert sources for other stories
- Suggest story ideas (not just your own)
- Be reliable expert source

### Working with Editors

**Understanding the Relationship**:
- Editors are gatekeepers, not adversaries
- Their job: maintain publication quality and serve readers
- They know their audience better than you
- They've seen thousands of pitches and articles

**Responding to Feedback**:
✅ **Good Response**: "Thanks for the feedback. I'll revise the structure and tighten the argument. Will have revised draft by [date]."

❌ **Bad Response**: "But this is how I want to write it. My way is better."

**Handling Rejection**:
- Thank them for considering
- Ask for feedback on why (if they have time)
- Ask if a revised angle would work
- Try again in 3-6 months with different idea

**Deadline Management**:
- Always meet agreed deadlines
- If problem arises, inform immediately (not day-of)
- Build buffer into your timeline
- Under-promise, over-deliver

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Disclosure Requirements

**Must Disclose**:
- Employment and affiliations
- Financial interests in mentioned companies
- Paid sponsorships or partnerships
- Conflicts of interest

**Disclosure Format**:
"[Author Name] is [Title] at [Company], which provides [brief description]. [Company] competes with [mentioned companies] mentioned in this article."

### Copyright and Attribution

**When Republishing**:
- Always get permission from original publication
- Use canonical tags to indicate original source
- Wait appropriate exclusivity period (typically 30-90 days)
- Disclose that article was originally published elsewhere

**Citing Others**:
- Always attribute ideas and quotes
- Link to original sources
- Paraphrase properly (not just word substitution)
- Get permission for extensive quotes

### Sponsored Content vs. Editorial

**Clearly Label**:
- Sponsored content must be marked as such
- "Sponsored by," "In partnership with," "Paid content"
- Editorial independence is valuable—don't compromise it
- Readers can distinguish authentic from promotional

**Maintaining Credibility**:
- If article promotes product/service, is it still valuable to readers?
- Would you write same article if not your company?
- Are you honest about limitations and alternatives?

## Content Adaptation Strategies

### Adapting for Different Publications

**Same Core Content, Different Angles**:

**Original Research**: "Analysis of 1,000 Kubernetes Deployments"

**For HBR**: "What Enterprise Kubernetes Deployments Reveal About Digital Transformation ROI"
- Focus: Business outcomes and strategic insights
- Audience: C-level
- Length: 1,500 words
- Data: Cost savings, time-to-market improvements

**For TechCrunch**: "Kubernetes Adoption Study: 73% of Teams Underestimate Complexity"
- Focus: Industry trend and practical challenges
- Audience: Tech professionals
- Length: 1,200 words
- Data: Adoption challenges, tooling gaps

**For Habr**: "Детальный анализ 1000 Kubernetes-кластеров: архитектурные паттерны и антипаттерны"
- Focus: Technical deep-dive and implementation patterns
- Audience: Developers and architects
- Length: 2,500 words
- Data: Configuration patterns, performance metrics

### Repurposing Content Effectively

**One Research Study → Multiple Articles**:

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief analysis for LinkedIn (500 words)
2. **Trend Analysis**: Business implications for Forbes (1,000 words)
3. **Technical Deep-Dive**: Implementation guide for Habr (2,500 words)
4. **Case Study**: Specific customer story for company blog (1,500 words)
5. **Whitepaper**: Comprehensive report with methodology (5,000+ words)

**Best Practices**:
- Adapt angle and depth, not just length
- Respect exclusivity periods
- Each version should feel native to platform
- Don't just republish verbatim
