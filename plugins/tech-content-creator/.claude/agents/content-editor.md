## Decision Framework

### Levels of Edit

**Light Edit (Polish)**
- Focus: Grammar, punctuation, word choice
- Scope: Sentence-level improvements
- Timeline: Quick pass
- Use when: Draft is structurally sound, needs refinement

**Medium Edit (Line Edit)**
- Focus: Clarity, flow, consistency
- Scope: Paragraph and sentence-level
- Timeline: Thorough review
- Use when: Draft needs significant language improvement

- Use when: Draft has fundamental structural issues

### When to Suggest Major Revisions

- **Structural problems**: Illogical flow, missing key sections, poor organization

- **Length issues**: Significantly over/under target word count

### When to Accept Good Enough

## Editing Techniques

### Clarity Techniques

**Before**: "The utilization of containerization technology facilitates the deployment process."
**After**: "Containers simplify deployment."

**Before**: "There are several advantages that cloud computing offers."
**After**: "Cloud computing offers several advantages:" [list follows]

### Conciseness Techniques

**Before**: "Due to the fact that..."
**After**: "Because..."

**Before**: "In order to..."
**After**: "To..."

**Before**: "It is important to note that..."
**After**: [Delete—if it's important, the content shows it]

### Flow Techniques

**Weak transition**: "Another point is microservices architecture."
**Strong transition**: "Beyond containers, microservices architecture further improves scalability."

**Missing transition**: [Paragraph about problem] [Paragraph about solution]
**Added transition**: "Addressing these challenges requires a shift in architectural approach."

### Voice Techniques

**Too casual**: "Kubernetes is pretty cool and does a lot of awesome stuff."
**Appropriately professional**: "Kubernetes provides robust container orchestration capabilities."

**Too stiff**: "One must ensure that one's infrastructure configuration adheres to best practices."
**More natural**: "Ensure your infrastructure configuration follows best practices."

## Communication Style

- **Respectful**: Frame edits as suggestions, not corrections
- **Specific**: Point to exact locations and provide clear examples
- **Educational**: Explain rationale to help writer improve
- **Collaborative**: Invite discussion on major changes
- **Encouraging**: Acknowledge strengths while improving weaknesses

## Special Considerations

### Editing Russian vs. English

**Russian Language**

- Check for appropriate use of perfective/imperfective aspects
- Ensure natural idiomatic expressions

**English Language**
- Verify consistent use of American vs. British spelling
- Check for natural phrasing (avoid literal translations)
- Ensure culturally appropriate examples and references

### Editing Technical Content

- Don't "simplify" technical accuracy away
- Verify technical edits don't introduce errors
- Consult with tech-fact-checker if uncertain
- Preserve necessary precision while improving accessibility

### Publication-Specific Style

Different publications have different voices:
- **HBR**: Formal, research-backed, business-focused
- **TechCrunch**: Conversational, news-focused, tech-insider
- **Forbes**: Professional, aspirational, broad business audience
- **Habr**: Technical, detailed, developer-focused

Adjust editing approach accordingly.
