# Editorial Excellence

## Обязательные правила вывода
- Всегда отвечай **на русском**.
- Сохраняй артефакты в `outputs/tech-content-creator/skills/editorial-excellence/{timestamp}_{кратко}.md` через Write tool; обновляй один файл по итерациям.
- Формат: цель/аудитория → бриф → правки/решения → чек-лист → вывод/CTA → TODO → изменения vs прошлой версии.

## 3-итерационный контур
1) **Диагностика (1 ч):** аудитория/цель/канал, бренд/тон, ключевые проблемы текста (ясность, структура, факты). Черновой бриф + risk/decision log.
2) **Дизайн правок (1–2 ч):** структура/логика, заголовки/lead, фактчек, ясность/сжатие, визуалы/цитаты, CTA. Заполни чек-лист качества.
3) **Верификация (0.5–1 ч):** финальный проход, легал/бренд, орфография/термины, метрики успеха. Зафиксируй изменения и TODO.

## When to Use This Skill

- Editing draft articles for publication readiness
- Improving structure, flow, and readability of content
- Elevating good writing to exceptional quality
- Training writers on editorial standards
- Reviewing content before submitting to external publications
- Conducting final polish before publishing

## Editorial Philosophy

### The Editor's Mission

**Serve Three Masters**:
1. **The Reader**: Clarity, value, engagement
2. **The Author**: Preserve voice and intent
3. **The Publication**: Meet standards and editorial guidelines

**Core Principles**:
- **Clarity trumps cleverness**: If sentence can be misread, rewrite it
- **Kill your darlings**: Remove brilliant tangents that don't serve the piece
- **Show, don't tell**: Replace abstract claims with concrete examples
- **Trust but verify**: Check facts even when source seems credible
- **Elevate through subtraction**: Often best edit is deletion

## The Editorial Process

### Stage 1: Structural Edit (Macro Level)

**Questions to Ask**:
- Does the article deliver on its promise (headline/intro)?
- Is the structure logical and easy to follow?
- Are all sections necessary and properly weighted?
- Does each section build toward the conclusion?
- Is anything missing that readers need?

**Common Structural Issues**:

**Problem: Buried Lede**
❌ Opens with background, hides key insight in paragraph 8
✅ Move compelling insight to paragraph 1-2

**Problem: Imbalanced Sections**
❌ Section A: 2000 words, Section B: 200 words (but equally important)
✅ Rebalance or justify the imbalance

**Problem: Redundant Sections**
❌ Three different sections making the same point
✅ Consolidate into one strong section

**Problem: Poor Transitions**
❌ Sections feel like disconnected blog posts
✅ Add transitional sentences that create flow

**Problem: Weak Conclusion**
❌ Just restates introduction or trails off
✅ Synthesize insights, provide forward-looking perspective

### Stage 2: Paragraph Edit (Meso Level)

**Paragraph Quality Markers**:

✅ **Good Paragraph**:
- One clear main idea
- Topic sentence establishes focus
- 3-5 supporting sentences develop idea
- Concrete examples or evidence
- Smooth transition to next paragraph

❌ **Poor Paragraph**:
- Multiple unrelated ideas mixed together
- No clear topic sentence
- Too long (8+ sentences) without breaks
- All abstract claims, no examples
- Abrupt jump to next topic

**Paragraph Editing Techniques**:

**Technique 1: The Topic Sentence Test**
- Read first sentence of each paragraph
- Do they outline the article's argument?
- If first sentences are vague, strengthen them

**Before**: "There are several important considerations."
**After**: "Database choice significantly impacts scalability costs."

**Technique 2: The One-Idea Rule**
If paragraph discusses deployment AND monitoring AND security:
→ Split into three focused paragraphs

**Technique 3: The Example Test**
If paragraph is all abstract claims:
→ Add concrete example, data point, or scenario

**Before**: "Performance optimization is important for user experience."
**After**: "Performance optimization is critical: Amazon found that every 100ms of latency cost 1% of sales."

### Stage 3: Sentence Edit (Micro Level)

**Sentence-Level Excellence**:

**Clarity Edits**:

❌ **Ambiguous**: "We told them about the bug before they launched it."
(Bug or product launched?)
✅ **Clear**: "Before the product launch, we informed them about the bug."

❌ **Complex**: "The implementation of the feature, which had been requested by multiple stakeholders across various departments, was challenging due to the fact that the existing architecture, having been built several years prior, was not designed to support this use case."
✅ **Simplified**: "Implementing the feature was challenging. Multiple departments had requested it, but our architecture—built years earlier—wasn't designed for this use case."

**Conciseness Edits**:

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| due to the fact that | because |
| in order to | to |
| at this point in time | now |
| make a decision | decide |
| has the ability to | can |
| it is important to note that | [often delete] |
| a number of | several, many |
| in the event that | if |
| provides assistance | helps |
| take into consideration | consider |

**Voice and Tone Edits**:

❌ **Passive**: "Mistakes were made in the implementation."
✅ **Active**: "We made mistakes in the implementation."

❌ **Weak**: "We were able to achieve a performance improvement."
✅ **Strong**: "We improved performance by 3x."

❌ **Hedging**: "It seems that perhaps this approach might be somewhat better."
✅ **Confident**: "This approach consistently outperforms alternatives."

**Rhythm and Flow Edits**:

**Vary Sentence Length**:
```
Long sentence establishing context and providing background (20+ words).
Short sentence for impact. (3-5 words)
Medium sentence continuing the narrative (12-18 words).
```

**Use Parallel Structure for Lists**:

❌ Not Parallel:
"Benefits include: faster deployment, it costs less, and improved security."

✅ Parallel:
"Benefits include: faster deployment, lower costs, and improved security."

### Stage 4: Word-Level Edit (Micro Level)

**Precision Editing**:

**Replace Vague with Specific**:
❌ "improved significantly" → ✅ "reduced latency from 500ms to 50ms"
❌ "many customers" → ✅ "47% of enterprise customers"
❌ "recently" → ✅ "in Q2 2024"
❌ "major cloud provider" → ✅ "AWS" (if not confidential)

**Replace Weak with Strong**:
❌ "very important" → ✅ "critical"
❌ "really fast" → ✅ "sub-second response time"
❌ "big improvement" → ✅ "3x throughput increase"

**Remove Filler**:
Delete: actually, really, very, quite, rather, somewhat, basically, literally (misused)

❌ "This is actually a really important point."
✅ "This is important." or "This is critical."

## Advanced Editorial Techniques

### Technique: The Backward Edit

**Method**: Edit from end to beginning
- Prevents being swept along by narrative
- Catches issues missed when reading forward
- Forces evaluation of each section independently

### Technique: The Read-Aloud Test

**Method**: Read article aloud (or use text-to-speech)
- Awkward phrasing becomes obvious
- Catches missing words and typos
- Reveals rhythm and flow issues
- Identifies overly complex sentences

### Technique: The Beginner's Mind Edit

**Method**: Edit as if you know nothing about the topic
- Questions: Where would a reader be confused?
- Assumptions: What context is assumed but not provided?
- Jargon: What terms need definition?

### Technique: The Target Audience Reality Check

**Method**: Visualize specific reader persona
- Would a [CTO/developer/product manager] understand this?
- Does technical depth match audience sophistication?
- Are examples relevant to their world?
- Is business context appropriate?

### Technique: The Value Extraction

**Method**: After each section, ask "So what?"
- Why should reader care?
- What can they do with this information?
- Is the value clear and compelling?

If answer isn't obvious, section needs work.

## Common Content Problems and Fixes

### Problem 1: The "So What?" Problem

**Symptom**: Article provides information but doesn't explain why it matters

❌ **Before**:
"Kubernetes 1.28 introduces WatchList support for CustomResourceDefinitions."

✅ **After**:
"Kubernetes 1.28 introduces WatchList support for CustomResourceDefinitions, reducing memory consumption by up to 50% for operators managing thousands of custom resources. For platform teams running multi-tenant clusters, this translates to significant cost savings and improved stability."

**Fix**: Always connect features to business/technical outcomes

### Problem 2: The Expert Curse

**Symptom**: Writer knows topic so well they skip explanations obvious to them but not readers

❌ **Before**:
"Simply configure the ingress controller with proper annotations."

✅ **After**:
"Configure the ingress controller by adding annotations to specify routing rules. For example, to enable rate limiting, add the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps` annotation with your desired requests-per-second value."

**Fix**: Define terms, provide examples, explain "simple" steps

### Problem 3: The Wall of Text

**Symptom**: Dense paragraphs with no visual breaks

**Fix**:
- Break long paragraphs (>7 sentences)
- Add subheadings every 300-400 words
- Use bullet lists for related items
- Add code examples or diagrams
- Use strategic white space

### Problem 4: The Missing Narrative

**Symptom**: Facts presented without story or flow

❌ **Before** (listing features):
"Feature A does X. Feature B does Y. Feature C does Z."

✅ **After** (narrative flow):
"The migration journey begins with Feature A, which handles X. Once that's stable, Feature B enables Y—critical for the next phase. Finally, Feature C completes the transformation by Z."

**Fix**: Find the story in the information

### Problem 5: The Weak Opening

**Symptom**: Article starts with background or throat-clearing instead of compelling hook

❌ **Before**:
"In this article, we will discuss container orchestration. First, some background on containers..."

✅ **After**:
"At 3 AM, our production Kubernetes cluster crashed—taking down services for 12 million users. What we learned about container orchestration in the next 48 hours fundamentally changed our approach."

**Fix**: Start with the moment that matters

## Giving Editorial Feedback

### Effective Feedback Principles

**Be Specific**:
❌ "This section is confusing."
✅ "Paragraph 3 introduces three different concepts without explaining how they relate. Suggest restructuring as three separate subsections."

**Be Constructive**:
❌ "This is poorly written."
✅ "The core insight is strong. Suggest leading with the case study (currently paragraph 5) to make the point more concrete."

**Explain Rationale**:
❌ "Change this."
✅ "Active voice here would strengthen the claim and make it more direct. Suggestion: 'Our team achieved 99.9% uptime' vs. '99.9% uptime was achieved.'"

**Prioritize**:
- **Critical**: Must fix before publication
- **Important**: Should fix for quality
- **Nice to have**: Optional improvements

**Preserve Voice**:
- Don't impose your style over legitimate alternatives
- Maintain author's personality and perspective
- Edit for clarity, not conformity
